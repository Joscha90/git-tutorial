## Preparatory work

- Create a GitHub account
- Setup a GIT client (e.g. SourceTree, GITkraken) and configure it for your identity (provide name and email in the configuration panel)
- Fork the **GIT Tutorial** repository
- Clone the newly forked repository on your local computer

## Tasks

### Task 1: Simple Commit to the repository
You will be working on *File 1.txt* in this exercise.

- Check out the *master* branch
- Open *File 1.txt*:
  -  Solve the last equation
  -  Write a new **unsolved** equation (for the next participant)
- Commit your work to the repository
- Push your changes to *your* remote
- Create a Pull-Request (PR) to the main repository
- Follow up on any further instruction

### Task 2: Contribute to a Pull Request
You will be working on *File 2.txt* in this exercise.

- Check the existing PR https://github.com/MaximeBaudette/git-tutorial/pull/1
- Check for existing error (You might need to scroll down to the latest update!)
- Check out the *example* branch
- Make sure your *example* branch is up-to-date with the one in the main repository
- Fix the wrong equation
- Write a new equation with a wrong answer
- Create a PR to the main repository (to the *example* branch)

### Task 3: Merge Conflicts
You will be working on *File 3.txt* in this exercise.

- Check out the *tutorial* branch
- Open *File_3.txt* and fix the grammar mistake
- Commit your work to the repository
- Push your changes to your remote
- Pull the *master* branch into your local branch
- Solve the conflicts, and commit the operation
- Open the *Finished Tutorial.md* file, and add your name to the list
- Commit your work and create a pull request to the main repository (to the *master* branch)

#### YOU'RE DONE !
I hope this will help you grasp how GIT works.
I will have a look at your pull requests and comment back if you did something wrong.
All in all this should take you about 30 minutes (less if you already have installed and configured SourceTree on your computer)
